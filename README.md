# Drinking-water-portability
Access to safe drinking water is essential to health, a basic human right, and a component of effective policy for health protection. This is important as a health and development issue at a national, regional, and local level. In some regions, it has been shown that investments in water supply and sanitation can yield a net economic benefit, since the reductions in adverse health effects and health care costs outweigh the costs of undertaking the interventions.
The drinkingwaterpotability.csv file contains water quality metrics for 3276 different water bodies
